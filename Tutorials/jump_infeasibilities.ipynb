    "Let's start by installing a Gurobi academic license. To start, first go to https://www.gurobi.com and click \"Register\" at the top right to create an account. Follow through the steps to confirm your account. Then, once you are logged in, click \"Licenses\", click \"Request\", and generate a \"Named-User Academic\" license. Follow the steps to install the license. Once a license is installed, you can run \"gurobi_cl\" in the command line to check that the license was installed correctly.\n",
